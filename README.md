2. Click on the "Settings" icon in the sidebar, then select "General."
3. Scroll down to the "Advanced" section and click on the "Export project" button.
4. Download the exported project file.
5. Create a new project on GitLab and give it a name according to [Naming Conventions](https://www.notion.so/Naming-Conventions-080a14ec00b243149b9848dd7533c302?pvs=4).
6. In the new project, click on the "Import project" button.
7. Select the exported project file as the import source and choose the "Create as a template project" option.

**Note:** Adhere to Palindrome's [Naming Conventions](https://www.notion.so/Naming-Conventions-080a14ec00b243149b9848dd7533c302?pvs=4) for code, notebook/script and folder naming and [Git Best Practices](https://www.notion.so/Git-Best-Practices-9ff74439890d4518860e958def235304?pvs=4).

## Overview

Provide overview of project.Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

***

## Technologies
List the technologies used in the development process inlcuding the programmming languages, cloud environment, orchestration frameworks, model versioning tools and any other technolgies relevant to the project.

***

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## FAQs
List some possible frequentyly asked questions
***

## Folder Structure
Add the project structure using the [project-tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhucy.project-tree) VScode functionality. 
 ***
## How to Run
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

## Authors and acknowledgement
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

***
## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
